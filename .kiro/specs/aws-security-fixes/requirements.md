# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the critical issues preventing full deployment of AWS security services in the Terraform configuration. The current implementation has several commented-out components due to IAM permissions, regional compatibility, and timeout issues. This feature will implement proper solutions to enable all security services while maintaining security best practices and regional compliance.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to enable EBS malware protection in GuardDuty without IAM permission errors, so that I can have comprehensive malware scanning for EBS volumes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying GuardDuty THEN the system SHALL enable EBS malware protection with proper IAM permissions
2. WHEN EBS malware protection is enabled THEN the system SHALL configure appropriate retention policies
3. IF IAM permissions are insufficient THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and remediation steps
4. WHEN EBS malware protection is active THEN the system SHALL validate the configuration through Terraform state

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want Inspector ECR and Lambda scanning to work reliably in EU regions, so that I can maintain consistent security posture across all deployments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying Inspector in EU regions THEN the system SHALL enable ECR scanning without timeout errors
2. WHEN deploying Inspector in EU regions THEN the system SHALL enable Lambda scanning without timeout errors
3. IF timeout issues occur THEN the system SHALL implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
4. WHEN Inspector services are enabled THEN the system SHALL verify service availability in the target region
5. WHEN regional deployment fails THEN the system SHALL provide region-specific troubleshooting guidance

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want Security Hub standards to be properly configured with correct regional ARNs, so that I can ensure compliance monitoring works across all AWS regions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying Security Hub THEN the system SHALL use region-appropriate standard ARNs
2. WHEN Security Hub standards are enabled THEN the system SHALL validate ARN format for the target region
3. IF regional ARNs are incorrect THEN the system SHALL automatically resolve the correct ARNs
4. WHEN Security Hub is configured THEN the system SHALL enable all applicable compliance standards
5. WHEN standards are enabled THEN the system SHALL verify successful subscription to each standard

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want comprehensive IAM policies that grant minimum required permissions, so that I can deploy all security services without over-privileging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating IAM policies THEN the system SHALL follow principle of least privilege
2. WHEN IAM policies are applied THEN the system SHALL enable all required security service features
3. IF permissions are missing THEN the system SHALL identify specific missing permissions
4. WHEN IAM roles are created THEN the system SHALL include proper trust relationships
5. WHEN deploying across regions THEN the system SHALL account for region-specific permission requirements

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want robust error handling and retry mechanisms, so that temporary AWS service issues don't cause deployment failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AWS API calls timeout THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff retry
2. WHEN service limits are reached THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages
3. IF regional services are unavailable THEN the system SHALL detect and report service status
4. WHEN retries are exhausted THEN the system SHALL provide actionable troubleshooting steps
5. WHEN deployment succeeds after retries THEN the system SHALL log successful recovery

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want region-aware configuration that automatically adapts to different AWS regions, so that I can deploy consistently across global infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying to any AWS region THEN the system SHALL automatically detect region-specific service availability
2. WHEN using regional ARNs THEN the system SHALL dynamically construct correct ARN formats
3. IF services are not available in a region THEN the system SHALL gracefully skip with appropriate warnings
4. WHEN region configuration changes THEN the system SHALL validate all dependent resources
5. WHEN deploying multi-region THEN the system SHALL handle cross-region dependencies properly
